# About Me

Hello! My name is Arica Conrad (pronouns she/her) and I am located in Bothell, Washington. I am a curious and creative person with a strong attention to detail and a passion for data and accessibility. With my technical, design, and customer service experience, I bring a unique perspective to any project I am working on. 

In June 2020, I graduated with my Associate of Arts in Integrated Science, which exposed me to a wide range of classes, including Calculus, Geology, English, Astronomy, Political Science, Jazz Appreciation, American Sign Language, and more. I started my AA degree as a Running Start student in high school.

I graduated in June 2022 with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mobile Application Development from Cascadia College. I also earned three certificates with my degree: Android App Development, iOS App Development, and Mobile Backend Services. In my degree, I gained experience using relational and NoSQL databases, API development, Git/GitHub, Android and iOS app development, technical writing, prototyping, project management, and UX design and research. I also did an internship for a fitness start-up based in Canada where I created 40+ prototype app screens in Figma, including dark mode variations and a proposed mental health section. My capstone project involved writing three tutorials for TechEase (an app project I was working on in my degree), programming those tutorials into the app, and then conducting in-person user testing with my client.

Since January 2023, I have been working as a part-time Library Page for Sno-Isle Libraries. I shelve books using their respective organizational systems, pull books off the shelves that are being requested for holds by patrons, perform customer service, find missing items, participate in the yearly inventory, and maintain general library cleanliness. I am also particularly good at finding misshelved items (items that are shelved incorrectly). I report an average of 60+ items a month, far more than the average Page. I also have 30+ instances of bringing up items to the librarians that have cataloging errors.

I believe my technical, design, and customer service experience makes me a great fit for a Technical Writing position. I bring with me my computer science degree, my experience using GitHub and Markdown (which is being used for this portfolio), strong writing and communication skills, and an ability to write for technical and non-technical audiences.
