# Technical Writing Samples

This part of my portfolio showcases my technical writing samples.

As required for my bachelor's degree, I took a Technical Writing class. In the group projects I was a part of, I focused on content as well. 

I am interested in technical writing because the words we use are very important. One explanation can be all the difference between someone understanding how to use an application versus closing the application in frustration.
