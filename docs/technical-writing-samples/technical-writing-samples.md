# Technical Writing Samples üìù

This part of my portfolio showcases my technical writing samples. 

As required for my bachelor's degree, I took a Technical Writing class where I learned how to write and edit resumes, memos, infographics, and more. I also focused on content in the many coding group projects I was a part of in my degree as well. I frequently updated our README files, created our GitHub issues and project boards, and wrote all the text the users would see on the user interfaces of our apps, such as the text on the buttons or the headings. In my capstone project, I wrote three tutorials on how to use common iOS apps/functionality for my app project, TechEase. You can find more information about TechEase [here](https://github.com/MobileApps-Cascadia/TechEase_iOS/wiki).

I am interested in technical writing because the words we use are very important. One explanation can be all the difference between someone understanding how to use an application versus closing the application in frustration. It is always a satisfying feeling knowing something you wrote helped someone else understand something. I get this same feeling in my current job as a Library Page when I help patrons find the exact item they are looking for. That feeling gives meaning and purpose to the work I do.
