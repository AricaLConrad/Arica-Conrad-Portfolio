# About This Assignment

In my Technical Writing class, we had an assignment to choose an article from a library database that uses technical language that is familiar to us and rewrite it in a way that would make sense to the average person. This assignment was open-ended, so we could choose any type of subject that we were familiar with (for instance, some students chose art or music as their subject). I decided on an article about analyzing websites using accessibility standards, as it was directly related to my degree.

# Original Article

"We evaluated the final four Web sites against the AA conformance level of WCAG 2.0. The selected Web sites contained different features and problems: in general, W1 and W2 satisfied more AA level success criteria (SC) than W3 and W4. The homepages of W1, W2, W3 and W4 satisfied respectively 73%, 69%, 52% and 36% of the SC for the AA level of WCAG 2.0. The most severe accessibility problem of W3 was that the seven links that conform the navigation menu, all of them have the same text which is 'image'. In the case of W4, the main accessibility problem is about Flash content which is not accessible using a screen reader. 

"Regarding the above-mentioned selection criteria with respect to branding, W1 and W3 represent internationally well-known restaurants with an innovative character and a culinary style based on research and creativity. In contrast, W2 and W4 Web sites correspond to restaurants that are locally popular and their style is based on traditional Basque cuisine. The visual design of the Web sites is in line with the style of the restaurant. The Web sites of the internationally well-known restaurants (W1 and W3) have more stylised visual layouts, as they have had their typographies designed and make use of high-quality close-up pictures. In contrast, the Web sites of the traditional-style restaurants (W2 and W4) have more basic and less elaborated visual aesthetic designs (see a snapshot of their homepages in Fig. 1).‚Äù

# My Rewrite

The final four websites were evaluated using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (recommended best practices for making websites accessible for all users). The chosen websites all had different features and problems, and some websites were more accessible than others. One website's main accessibility problem was that the seven different links in the navigation bar all would be read and said aloud as "image" by a screen reader, instead of the actual text. (A screen reader is a tool for sight-impaired users that reads images and text displayed on a screen out loud to the user.) Another website's main accessibility problem was the prevalent use of Adobe Flash, a tool for seeing certain types of digital content, which screen readers are unable to read.

Two of the websites represent well-known restaurants who value innovation, research, and creativity in planning their menu. The other two websites represent local restaurants whose food is based on traditional Basque (a southern European ethnic group) cuisine. The design of each of the websites matches the personal style of the restaurant. The websites of the well-known restaurants have a customized text font and numerous high-quality photos. The websites of the traditional restaurants have a more basic design scheme (the homepages of each website are shown in Fig. 1).
