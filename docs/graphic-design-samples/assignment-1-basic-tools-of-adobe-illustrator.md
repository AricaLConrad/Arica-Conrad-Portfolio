# Assignment 1 - Basic Tools of Adobe Illustrator ✒️

# About This Assignment

For the first assignment in my graphic design class, we were going to be using Adobe Illustrator for the first time. We were instructed to experiment with the different shape tools and explore Adobe Illustrator's vast library of patterns and strokes. My professor also wanted us to use a grayscale palette for this assignment.

# Final Submission

This was my final submission for Assignment 1. I also attached this picture in a post to a Canvas discussion forum for peer analysis by my classmates.

The top left box has random lines; the top right box has overlapping rectangles and squares; the center left box has overlapping circles and ellipses; the center right box has overlapping, distorted stars; the bottom left box has random, overlapping shapes, such as a crown; and the bottom right box has a spiraling line leading to a star in the middle, with stars and circles placed on the spiraling line in each corner of the box, and overall creating a final picture that looks like a spiral galaxy." width="100%" height="100%"/>

There are six boxes in my final submission and they each represent different tools in Adobe Illustrator. The top left box explores the use of the line tool with both straight lines and curved lines. The top right box uses the square/rectangle tool, some of which have rounded corners. The center left box experiments with the circle tool, and some of the circles became ellipses when distorted. The center right box uses the star tool, with some distortion being applied to the points. The bottom left box explores creating freehanded shapes. And finally, the bottom right box uses at least three of the tools used in the previous pictures to create any picture we wanted.

I had a lot of fun playing around with strokes and patterns. I experimented with different shades of gray instead of color to show depth and contrast, as described in the assignment's instructions. Some of the shapes use patterns that I thought represented their shapes. For instance, the crown shape in the bottom left box uses a pattern of diamonds, as it reminded me of jewels on a crown. 

For my bottom right design, I was inspired by the spiraling background line in my top left box. When I used that stroke on a black background, it looked like a spiral galaxy. I added a glowing star shape in the middle of the picture to represent the black hole at the center of the galaxy. I then layered stars and circular planets to orbit the black hole. Combining all of these elements created a final picture with a distinct circular movement. I wanted my viewer to feel like they were falling into the black hole when they looked at my picture.
